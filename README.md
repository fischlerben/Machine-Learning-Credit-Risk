Unit 11 HW - Risky Business

In this assignment, credit-related data is utilized in different models (Logistic Regression, Balanced Random Forest, Easy Ensemble) in order to predict a customer's credit risk.  After each model is run, different evaluation metrics are calculated (accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report) in order to determine which model best suits the data.  Re-sampling of data (Oversampling/SMOTE, Undersampling/Cluster Centroids, and SMOTEENN) is also performed.
