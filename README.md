Unit 11 HW - Risky Business

In this assignment, credit-related data is used in a number of different models (Logistic Regression, Balanced Random Forest, and Easy Ensemble) in order to predict a customer's credit risk.  After each model is run, different evaluation metrics are calculated (accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report) in order to determine which model best predicts what we need it to predict.
